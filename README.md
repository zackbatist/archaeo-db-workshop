## Description
Databases are crucial components of the archaeological toolbox that facilitate with the storage, organization and retrieval of information across a project. However, designing and implementing archaeological databases can be challenging due to the technical learning curve involved, the unique needs of archaeological projects, and lack of support or guidance.

This two-hour workshop will focus on fundamental aspects of database design, and teach participants how to construct information systems for various purposes. This is intended to be an active and participatory session. As an introductory overview, no prior knowledge or experience is expected.

## Workshop Structure
1. About this workshop
2. What is a [relational] database?
3. Setting up a Database Management System
  - Setting up and accessing a database server
  - Command line basics
  - SQL basics
  - **Activity: Create and access your database**
4. Structuring the database
  - Scoping and creating tables
  - **Activity: Scope and create tables**
  - **Activity: Import data if you've got some**
  - Creating indexes and relationships
  - **Activity: Create indexes and relationships**
5. Manipulating data
  - INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE and JOIN queries
  - **Activity: Practice data manipulation**
6. Front-end development
  - **Demo: FLIRT**
7. Wrap up


## Learning Outcomes
- Understand what a database is, and how it relates to other aspects of an archaeological information infrastructure
- Understand how to design and maintain effective data structures
- Understand how to input, modify and retrieve data
- Create your own research database to suit your specific needs
- Become a profficient user of the command line and develop practical computing skills

## Expectations
- Participants will bring their own laptop
- Participants will bring a copy of their own dataset to work with, or be able to think through the specific aspects of the data that they hope to collect in the future
- Participants are comfortable using a computer, with no assumptions about prior programming or networking knowledge
- Participants will be asked to fill out a pre-workshop survey, and share feedback for further improvement
- Participants will receive primers/cheatsheets via email prior to the workshop relating to:
  - laptop setup instructions,
  - working on the command line,
  - SQL basics

## Facilitation Guidelines
- The workshop is led by a facilitator driving the session according to the structure presented above
- Use a [shared notepad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/archaeo-db-workshop) for:
  - Sharing notes and links
  - Jargon-busting
